# Signal Processing Research

Main goals currently are denoising, own-voice suppression, and speech separation. [speech_separation](./speech_separation) needs to be updated to reflect latest work. lots of it is non-functional right now. 

Most of the important code lives in:
-  [denoise](./denoise) for denoising related work
- [own_voice_suppression](./own_voice_suppression) for own-voice suppression and some speech separation work
- [general_utils](./general_utils) for general purpose audio manipulation utilities (resampling, concatenating, mixing, etc)
- [hailo_demo](./hailo_demo) for code related to deploying models on Hailo hardware
